# LogLib
Logging library for console/file/stream homework.

these static c# loggers was made by skippy for homework purposes
most of the functions are using the main Log method
eg: ConsoleLogger.Info("hi everyone"); it is an info log message
saved as calling the ConsoleLogger.Log method with the type of Info and the input message.
The same is true for all the types.
